**Colleague:** That sounds perfect, honestly. Sometimes simple is best.

**You:** Exactly. What about you?

**Colleague:** I need to prepare dinner for my family, help my kid with homework, then maybe read a bit.

**You:** Sounds like a full evening!

**Colleague:** It is, but it's nice. Keeps me busy.
