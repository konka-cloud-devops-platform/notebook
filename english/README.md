Konka, this is a **very good and mature decision** 👍
You’re not asking for random English — you’re asking for **work-ready spoken English that should come automatically from your mouth**. That’s exactly the right goal.

Below is a **practical soft-skills speaking program** designed **only for your listed conversation types**.
No bookish English. No fancy words. Simple, repeatable, daily practice.

---

## 🔹 How This Program Works (Important)

* You **don’t memorize paragraphs**
* You **repeat patterns**
* You **speak daily for 20–30 minutes**
* Same structure → different situations → confidence builds automatically

Think of this like **kubectl commands for your mouth** 😄
Once practiced enough, they come naturally.

# 🗂️ SOFT SKILLS SPEAKING PROGRAM (DEVOPS-FOCUSED)

## 1️⃣ Work Conversations (Daily Stand-ups, Task Updates)

### 🎯 Goal

Speak **clearly, briefly, confidently**.

### 🔁 Daily Stand-up Template (MOST IMPORTANT)

Practice this **every single day** 👇

```
Yesterday, I worked on <task>.
Today, I’m planning to work on <task>.
Currently, I don’t have any blockers.
```

### 🔹 Variations (VERY COMMON)

* “I’m almost done, just testing remaining.”
* “Work is in progress, I’ll update once completed.”
* “I’m waiting for confirmation from <team>.”

### 🗣️ Daily Practice (5 mins)

Say this **out loud**, even if alone:

> “Yesterday I worked on EKS networking.
> Today I’m working on network policies.
> No blockers as of now.”

## 2️⃣ Stakeholder Conversations (Progress, Issues, Timelines)

### 🎯 Goal

Sound **calm, professional, solution-oriented**

### 🔹 Progress Update Lines

* “The task is currently in progress.”
* “We are on track as per the timeline.”
* “Initial setup is completed, testing is ongoing.”

### 🔹 Issue Explanation (CRITICAL SKILL)

```
We observed an issue with <problem>.
The root cause is <reason>.
We are working on a fix.
Expected resolution is <time>.
```
